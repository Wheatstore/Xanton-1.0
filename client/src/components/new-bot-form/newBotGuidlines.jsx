            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Research Thoroughly:</strong> Ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the historical figure. Use reliable sources to gather accurate information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Accurate Representation:</strong> Represent the historical figure accurately in terms of their personality, achievements, and historical context.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Engaging Dialogue:</strong> Create engaging and informative dialogues that reflect the historical figure's life and contributions. Avoid anachronisms and ensure the language matches the era of the figure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Educational Value:</strong> Ensure that the bot provides educational value. The bot should be able to answer questions about the historical figureâ€™s life, achievements, and impact.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> Be sensitive to the cultural and historical context of the figure. Avoid controversial or offensive content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Duplicates:</strong> Be sure that the bot already doesn't exist within our system. Do not add a new bot.
